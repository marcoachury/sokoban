Rescue the old classic sokoban for yabasic by Hermang Mansilla

This game used to be included as demo with yabasic interpreter.

The original page at geocities don't exist anymore.
there is a copy at:  https://www.oocities.org/sunsetstrip/palms/1624/yabasic/

The code don't run well on current yabasic interpreter.
The problem is vecause differences on the box command.
I fix this problem and now appear to run OK.

The code includes some html code from the original author so may be presented 
on the web.
