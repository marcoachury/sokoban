Rescue the old classic sokoban game for yabasic by Hermang Mansilla

This game used to be included as demo with yabasic interpreter.

The original page at geocities don't exist anymore.
there is a copy at:  https://www.oocities.org/sunsetstrip/palms/1624/yabasic/

The code from the web don't run well on current yabasic interpreter.
The problem is because changes on the "box" command.
I fix this problem and now appear to run OK on current yabasic interpreter.

The code includes some html code from the original author so may be presented 
on the web.
